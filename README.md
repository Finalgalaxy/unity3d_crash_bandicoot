CrashRemake is or tries to be my personal project for trying to make a game by using Unity3D w/ Blender.

DISCLAMER: I do not own Crash Bandicoot copyrights. This project is meant to be for learning how Unity3D engine works in 3D mode and probably it will be my first 3D game.
In case time helps me, models will be updated in order to remove copyrighted materials.

And yes, I'm a fan of Crash saga.

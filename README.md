CrashRemake is or tries to be my personal project for trying to make a game by using Unity3D w/ Blender.

Updates are in commits section. Actually I'm working solo.

DISCLAMER: I do not own Crash Bandicoot copyrights. This project is meant to be for learning how Unity3D engine works in 3D mode and probably it will be my first 3D game ever.

Models will be updated in order to remove copyrighted materials once the actual game is successfully developed. While it stays in tech-demo state, I'll promise to use as less copyrighted material as possible, in order to keep the project DMCA-free.

If there are problems, don't hesitate to contact me in order to remove the copyrighted material. Again this project is not made to make money by using Crash Bandicoot IP, it's just a way to make things more interesting since I'm a fan of Crash saga and that character gives me a LOT of motivation into developing. Thanks for reading.
